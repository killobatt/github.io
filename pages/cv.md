#### iOS Team Lead at Lohika
###### Present - February 2016

+ [Biovotion](http://www.biovotion.com) Biovotion produces a medical grade device to monitor human vital signs.
+ [Bellwether CoffeeÂ®](https://www.bellwethercoffee.com) Bellwether makes a first-of-its-kind, zero-emissions, commercial coffee beans roaster controlled via iPad. The software solution covers coffee roasting, in-house beans accounting, e-commerce and IoT services. My responsibilities were:
    - Team leadership
    - Project kickoff, building software delivery process
    - Overall system design including e-commerce, coffee beans roasting and accounting
    - iOS application construction activities, such as architechture design and implementation, unit and integration testing, code review, CI.

The main challenge was in delivery of the quality software product without the hardware prototype in hands. I built a set of unit and integration tests working with hardware simulator created by my team. This allowed us to get system up and running very quickly when real hardware prototype was delivered to us.
